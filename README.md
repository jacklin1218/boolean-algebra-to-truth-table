# Boolean algebra to truth table 



## Getting Started

you can made truth table from boolean algebra

my program will show you truth table and save as .csv(execl) 

## input example

I support some sign:

() //you can use () mean high priority

' //it means prime or not

you can input boolean algebra like this

a+a'bc(a+c)

dont press space in per boolean algebra

## important tip

if you have plural input please input the all letters at first

if you have

ab+c a+d ab bc' b(a)c'

please press

abcd at first

your input will like this

abcd ab+c a+d ab bc' b(a)c'

but if your input like this

ab a+b+c bc

you just need let a+b+c at first

your input like this

a+b+c ab bc
